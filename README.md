# animonitor
A Utility program which scrapes websites for new anime (content news sites) so I can  know when new episodes of shows drop I plan for this to track new episodes twice a day and to be able to track other releases such as manga releases and such hopefully I aim to later implement this as a passive android app
should probably work on somewhere to save these maybe another py program with lists 
get the variables name and website

-check if the website is ok and for any redirects so i wont need to constantly upload url
-use webscaper to grab the entire html of the page to store locally
-once the page receives new content
-code needs to subtract the new content from the old to get the differnece
-the difference should contain the names of any new content as well as the episode number and date released

later implementation

-to automate instead of doing one for the development I should just be able to manage and create new requests able to adjust the checking frequency and website
-hopefully have this work universally between webpages

hopes
-for actual use the option of having this as an android app working in the background
